# AndroidCV

Assistant app for [Direct Current's TeamCode](https://github.com/Team5893/TeamCode). AndroidCV is a place to apply filters and then use screenshots to determine appropriate HSV values for OpenCV.

Extremely lightweight, only holds a camera view.
Change in filters has to be done through code, and then recompiled to the phone.

Works best in landscape mode.
